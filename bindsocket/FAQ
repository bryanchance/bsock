bindsocket FAQ

Q. bindsocket: permission denied
A. The owner of the process attempting to connect to the bindsocket daemon is
   not part of group 'daemon' (or the group to which bindsocket is configured
   to restrict access to the socket).  Alternatively, this might indicate that
   the daemon is not running and bindsocket was not installed setuid root.
   (Installing bindsocket setuid root with 'install-setuid' Makefile target
    is not the default.)
