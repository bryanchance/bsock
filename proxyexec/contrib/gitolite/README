"Gitolite allows you to setup git hosting on a central server, with
 fine-grained access control and many (many!) more powerful features."



gitolite v3 proxyexec INPUT trigger:

gitolite v3 provides a trigger mechanism for plugins.
ProxyExec.pm is an INPUT trigger to translate args from proxyexec
into SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND and username arg expected by gitolite.
# installation notes for ProxyExec.pm gitolite INPUT trigger:
# - copy ProxyExec.pm to gitolite/src/lib/Gitolite/Triggers/ProxyExec.pm
# - define extension in rc file ($ENV{HOME}/.gitolite.rc) before ENABLE => [ ...
#      NON_CORE => "
#          ProxyExec INPUT :: before Shell
#      ",
# - add 'ProxyExec', to ENABLE list in .gitolite.rc (near system admin stuff)


gitolite v2 patching:

To avoid an intermediate script to translate proxyexec command execution to
input expected by gitolite v2 gl-auth-command, patch gitolite as follows.
Note: part of the patch is required to relax a regex in gitolite which looks
for single quotes around the repo argument, since the single quotes are removed
by command line word expansion that is performed in the proxyexec client.


# In hosting account (e.g. 'scmadmin' or 'git'),
# download gitolite, patch, and install
# (set $REPO to path to directory holding bsock.git clone)

$ git clone https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite.git
$ cd gitolite/src
$ patch gl-auth-command \
    < $REPO/bsock/proxyexec/contrib/gitolite/gl-auth-command.patch



Continue and follow the rest of the gitolite installation instructions.
