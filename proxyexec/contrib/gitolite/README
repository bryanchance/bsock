From http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/ :

"Gitolite allows you to setup git hosting on a central server, with
 fine-grained access control and many (many!) more powerful features."



Patching gitolite:

To avoid an intermediate script to translate proxyexec command execution to
input expected by gl-auth-command or gitolite-shell, patch gitolite as follows.
Note: part of the patch is required to relax a regex in gitolite which looks
for single quotes around the repo argument, since the single quotes are removed
by command line word expansion that is performed in the proxyexec client.


# In hosting account (e.g. 'scmadmin' or 'git'),
# download gitolite, patch, and install
# (set $REPO to path to directory holding bsock.git clone)

$ git clone https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite.git
$ cd gitolite/src

# (gitolite v2 only)
#$ patch gl-auth-command \
#    < $REPO/bsock/proxyexec/contrib/gitolite/gl-auth-command.patch

# (gitolite v3 only)  (recommended)
$ patch gitolite-shell \
    < $REPO/bsock/proxyexec/contrib/gitolite/gitolite-shell.patch


Continue and follow the rest of the gitolite installation instructions.
