proxyexec - proxy command execution without setuid

COPYING - copyright/license
NOTES   - technical notes

proxyexec is an executable that builds with libbsock.so and can be used
as a login shell or as the target of an sshd_config ForceCommand to
leverage operating system authentication to passing credentials to a
service program running under a single account.

proxyexec handles client/server communication by passing argv and stdin,
stdout, stderr fds over unix domain socket between processes owned by
different users.


Usage
-----

proxyexec client mode connects to a socket based <cmd>
  proxyexec -c <cmd> [args]*

proxyexec server (daemon) mode listens on the provided socket path
  proxyexec -d [-F] [-q] -s <sock> <cmd> [args]*

proxyexec server (daemon) mode requires the listen socket path be provided.
Compile-time root of sockets is /var/run/proxyexec/ (when installed from RPM)
or else /usr/local/var/run/proxyexec.  The path to the socket to handle a
particular request is /var/run/proxyexec/<cmd>/socket and the admin setting
up the daemon must create (mkdir) /var/run/proxyexec/<cmd>/.  The permissions
can be set on this directory to control who is able to connect to the socket
that is created within.  Default permissions are restrictive.
See proxyexec/NOTES, as well as bsock/FAQ and bsock/NOTES, for more details.

When a connection is accepted from proxyexec client, the command that proxyexec
runs begins with <cmd> [args]* provided on the proxyexec -d command line,
followed by the argv passed by the client.  The working directory is the dir
in which proxyexec was started.  The command is executed with execv(); shell
interpretation is bypassed.  The client environment is not transferred, except
for a few variables used for logging.  The target command must still take care
to sanitize the environment before executing any shell commands.
(The same advice is true for setuid/setgid programs, too.)
