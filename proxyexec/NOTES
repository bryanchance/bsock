Security
--------

Depending on how proxyexec is used, it should be noted that proxyexec can be
used as an amplifier to cause a denial-of-service (DoS), due to proxyexec
forking a target process for each request received on the socket.  (Forking a
process is much more expensive than is connecting to a socket.)  proxyexec
does log the uid, gid, and socketpath of each request and so the misbehaving
account(s) can more easily be identified.  This type of attack is similar to
fork bombing a machine but is mentioned here because resource limits on number
of processes on a requesting account restrict the origin account, but do not
restrict the account running the proxyexec daemon, unless resource limits are
also applied to the account running the proxyexec daemon.  If the daemon is
serving multiple accounts, restricting the number of processes allowed by the
daemon account can avoid resource exhaustion on the machine at the cost of
possibly reducing the availability of the specific service provided by the
daemon.

proxyexec does not currently provide a mechanism to limit the number of
outstanding requests (i.e. number of running child processes), but might
do so in the future if there is sufficient demand for this feature.
