bsock installation

  $ make
  $ make install

  # Edit and add entries to /usr/local/etc/bsock
  # Edit and add entries to /usr/local/etc/bsock.resvaddr (optional)

  # Add bsock to your favorite set of system init scripts:
  #   /usr/local/sbin/bsock -d
  # (Hint: start bsock after networking interfaces are configured)

  # Configure syslog to log daemon.info (optional, but recommended)

  # Configure privileged daemons to use bsock without running as root
  #   Add the role account running the daemon to group 'daemon'
  #     (or change secure-by-default permissions on socket -- see NOTES file)
  #   LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libbsock_preload.so <daemon_program>

See NOTES for more technical (and probably less readable) details and features.
See Makefile for various overrides, such as alternate installation location.

bsock config file line format:
    username address_family socket_type protocol service_or_port address
    e.g. apache AF_INET SOCK_STREAM tcp 80 0.0.0.0
- specify separate lines for each difference, since exact match is performed
  (and use single space character between fields; no leading or trailing space)
- strings are case-sensitive
    use uppercase addr family, socktype constants (e.g. AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
    use lowercase for protocol (e.g. tcp) or alias in /etc/protocols
- use port 0 if service_or_port does not apply to addr family (e.g. AF_UNIX)
- blank lines and comments (lines beginning with #) are skipped
- address must be an address string not a constant, e.g.
   0.0.0.0            (for INADDR_ANY)
   127.0.0.1          (for INADDR_LOOPBACK)
   255.255.255.255    (for INADDR_BROADCAST)
   ::                 (for IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT)
   ::1                (for IN6ADDR_LOOPBACK_INIT)
- config file updates should be made atomically with mv; config files
  should not be updated in-place (prevent corruption during processing).

bsock.resvaddr config file line format:
- same as bsock config, except omit 'username' field
  e.g. AF_INET SOCK_STREAM tcp 80 0.0.0.0
