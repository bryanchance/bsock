bsock FAQ

Q. bsock: permission denied
A. The owner of the process attempting to connect to the bsock daemon is not
   part of group 'daemon' (or the group to which bsock is configured to
   restrict access to the socket).  Alternatively, this might indicate that the
   daemon is not running and bsock was not installed setuid root.  (Installing
   bsock setuid root with 'install-setuid' Makefile target is not the default.)
